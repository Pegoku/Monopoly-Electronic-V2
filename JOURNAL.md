## 10/3/2025 - Simple draft of the project  

I drew a simple draft of the project. 
For this project, I would like to have the following features:
- MCU (maybe Wi-Fi for future mobile/web integration)
- NFC reader
- TFT display
- Speaker
- Action buttons
- Battery (at least a few hours of battery life, maybe an 18650 or multiple AA batteries)

## 10/4/2025 - Research possible parts  

I've been searching for the possible parts I could use for my project. I've seen many options, some more expensive, others cheaper. I have ended up selecting most of the parts from Digikey, due to the huge variety and fast shipping.
I've created a [digikey list](https://www.digikey.es/en/mylists/list/QVK6J72RAV) with all the parts that will be used.

## 10/6/2025 9 AM - Work on the Power/battery part of the schematic  

I have been working on the battery part of the schematic.
I have wired most of the BQ25895RTWR, and USB-C port. Only the 3.3V buck is left.
I arrived to the conclusion about not needing the 5V from the BQ25895RTWR, as everything will be running from 3.3V, so I disabled it.

## 10/6/2025 6 PM - Work on the Logic part of the schematic  

I've been working on the Logic part of the shematic. The programming part should be done, I used a vertical USB-C port I'll have hidden inside, and regular UART as a fallback.
I also added an I2S Audio driver (MAX98357A) as I didn't want to just use PWM, but didn't need something too fancy for simple sound effects.
Now I'll just need to add a display, which I'll be changing to a bigger one. Maybe, I'll get one with touch support
