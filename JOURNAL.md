## 10/3/2025 - Simple draft of the project  

I drew a simple draft of the project. 
For this project, I would like to have the following features:
- MCU (maybe Wi-Fi for future mobile/web integration)
- NFC reader
- TFT display
- Speaker
- Action buttons
- Battery (at least a few hours of battery life, maybe an 18650 or multiple AA batteries)
