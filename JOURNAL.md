## 10/3/2025 - Simple draft of the project  

I drew a simple draft of the project. 
For this project, I would like to have the following features:
- MCU (maybe Wi-Fi for future mobile/web integration)
- NFC reader
- TFT display
- Speaker
- Action buttons
- Battery (at least a few hours of battery life, maybe an 18650 or multiple AA batteries)

## 10/4/2025 - Research possible parts  

I've been searching for the possible parts I could use for my project. I've seen many options, some more expensive, others cheaper. I have ended up selecting most of the parts from Digikey, due to the huge variety and fast shipping.
I've created a [digikey list](https://www.digikey.es/en/mylists/list/QVK6J72RAV) with all the parts that will be used.

## 10/6/2025 9 AM - Work on the Power/battery part of the schematic  

I have been working on the battery part of the schematic.
I have wired most of the BQ25895RTWR, and USB-C port. Only the 3.3V buck is left.
I arrived to the conclusion about not needing the 5V from the BQ25895RTWR, as everything will be running from 3.3V, so I disabled it.

## 10/6/2025 6 PM - Work on the Logic part of the schematic  

I've been working on the Logic part of the shematic. The programming part should be done, I used a vertical USB-C port I'll have hidden inside, and regular UART as a fallback.
I also added an I2S Audio driver (MAX98357A) as I didn't want to just use PWM, but didn't need something too fancy for simple sound effects.
Now I'll just need to add a display, which I'll be changing to a bigger one. Maybe, I'll get one with touch support

## 10/7/2025 - Find a possible suitable LCD  

After all, I decided for an SPI TFT LCD. I'll be going with a 3.2" touch ST7789 SPI display. it seems to be big enough, and have more than enough resolution for my project. Also, it seems to be supported with some libraries.
It also has touch, just in case I ever want to use it.

## 10/8/2025 - Finish Schematic routing  

I finished all the schematic routing (PCB, NFC, etc). The display seemed hard, but it really was just two SPI devices (Display and Touch).
I think everything should be done now. I only need to select all components (resistors, capacitors, etc) so I can use the correct footprints.
