## 10/3/2025 - Simple draft of the project  

I drew a simple draft of the project. 
For this project, I would like to have the following features:
- MCU (maybe Wi-Fi for future mobile/web integration)
- NFC reader
- TFT display
- Speaker
- Action buttons
- Battery (at least a few hours of battery life, maybe an 18650 or multiple AA batteries)

## 10/4/2025 - Research possible parts  

I've been searching for the possible parts I could use for my project. I've seen many options, some more expensive, others cheaper. I have ended up selecting most of the parts from Digikey, due to the huge variety and fast shipping.
I've created a [digikey list](https://www.digikey.es/en/mylists/list/QVK6J72RAV) with all the parts that will be used.

## 10/6/2025 11 AM - Work on the Power/battery part of the schematic  

I have been working on the battery part of the schematic.
I have wired most of the BQ25895RTWR, and USB-C port. Only the 3.3V buck is left.
I arrived to the conclusion about not needing the 5V from the BQ25895RTWR, as everything will be running from 3.3V, so I disabled it.

## 10/6/2025 8 PM - Work on the Logic part of the schematic  

I've been working on the Logic part of the shematic. The programming part should be done, I used a vertical USB-C port I'll have hidden inside, and regular UART as a fallback.
I also added an I2S Audio driver (MAX98357A) as I didn't want to just use PWM, but didn't need something too fancy for simple sound effects.
Now I'll just need to add a display, which I'll be changing to a bigger one. Maybe, I'll get one with touch support

## 10/7/2025 - Find a possible suitable LCD  

After all, I decided for an SPI TFT LCD. I'll be going with a 3.2" touch ST7789 SPI display. it seems to be big enough, and have more than enough resolution for my project. Also, it seems to be supported with some libraries.
It also has touch, just in case I ever want to use it.

## 10/8/2025 - Finish Schematic routing  

I finished all the schematic routing (PCB, NFC, etc). The display seemed hard, but it really was just two SPI devices (Display and Touch).
I think everything should be done now. I only need to select all components (resistors, capacitors, etc) so I can use the correct footprints.

## 10/10/2025 - Assign footprints + backlight driving options  

I assigned all the necessary footprints to the symbols, and I also chose which parts I will be using for the PCB. I added all of them to the [Digikey BOM](https://www.digikey.es/en/mylists/list/QVK6J72RAV).
Also, as I don't currently have the display, nor, know how the LED backlight is connected, I added multiple driving circuits. They are all disabled by default (have to use jumpers). And when I get all the components, I will use the correct driver method.

## 10/11/2025 10 AM - Groups to the schematic and start placing components  

I have reordered the schematic so I can more easily reference the components and, at a glance, find them.
I've used rectangles and text so I can name all the groups.

Then, I've started placing the components in the PCB. I'll start with what I always do, group the components and try to place them with their "ideal" placement.
This is what I've got so far:

## 10/11/2025 8 PM - Finish placing the components  

I finished placing all the components in their "ideal" place. Due to the bigger than firstly planned display, the PCB ended up being 93.3 x 128.35 mm. which isn't a lot bigger than intented, but it will make the final device bigger, not a huge dealbreaker, though.

## 10/12/2025 - Start routing top part of the pcb  

I have started routing part of the pcb. as I already had all the components placed, I only have to connect them, which isn't too hard. I'm also using copper pours for some parts of the pcb, eg. buck.
For now, I've routed the usb charge connector, battery circuit and charger and buck.

## 10/13/2025 - Finish routing the PCB  

I finished routing all the PCB. It should now be done. I will now start designing the case. I will try to make it similar to the drawing I did before (first journal entry), while also having the essence of the original [Monopoly Electronic i have](https://imgs.search.brave.com/97KW8I4h7B_5Km5_sD36x9mR6GnvyAEScB285sH_O2Q/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pLmVi/YXlpbWcuY29tL2lt/YWdlcy9nLzBPQUFB/T1N3aEExbWx3Y0sv/cy1sMTYwMC5qcGc).

## 10/15/2025 - Start Cadding  

I have started the CAD design. I've added a speaker grill (spent too much time making it look good, battery pocket for easy battery replacement (if necessary) and pcb "rails" so the pcb can easily be mounted. 
For now I'll be doing only the "raw" parts of the case. then I'll add more complex/visual features.

This is what I've got so far:
